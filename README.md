# Phishing-site

In order to run this project locally, first run the xampp/wampp server.

Then put all files (index.html and login.php file) and the folder (Sign in or Register _ eBay_files) which contain source code
and images of the web page to the folder called htdocs(xampp).

By typing localhost:8080 as the URL in the browser, we can locally host the site.
